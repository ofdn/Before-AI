# Foundational Language Tech for Low-Resource Languages
A set of frameworks for building the foundational technological layers for low and limited resource languages.

This project will re-imagine the foundational technology infrastructure needed to kickstart the artificial intelligence / machine learning frameworks for some of the low-resourced languages with a focus on such languages in South Asia. Join us in building a more diverse, equitable, and community-run AI ecosystem for global languages starting in South Asia.

This project was initiated by the O Foundation around August-September 2021 as a part of the [MozFest Trustworthy AI Working Groups program](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304203547/https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/get-involved/building-trustworthy-ai-working-group/), a cohort by the Mozilla Foundation around building trustworthy AI and making the same a reality through a collaborative practice.

## Problem
The problems -- that some of under-resourced South Asian languages communities are facing while creating the foundational tech resources that are needed for the future AI/ML innovations -- are many. While lack of technical infrastructure and technical knowhow among the native speakers are often referred to as the key problems, such problems are often a result of the historical oppression of indigenous communities by dominant communities. For instance, the caste system in the South Asian Hindu society that was existing prior to the European colonizations has continued to contribute to the post-colonial exploitation of a wide number of Dalit-Bahujan-Adivasi (a term often used to denote the most marginalized communities in the region) groups. Many low-resource languages in the region are spoken primarily by the Adivasi communities that are mostly indigenous groups. We recognize historic oppression as a key problem behind the growth of most languages on the digital spaces including the internet. It is evident today from the stark contrast between the the steep growth in the use of dominant languages and the poor support available to many low-resource languages. As the growth in the foundational technology that is required to drive the Web 3.0-led in many low-resource languages is in different stages for different languages, we recognize that the unique strategies and methodologies by such language communities are poorly documented.

## Linguistic context
Each human language is unique, and there are more than 6,500 languages that are spoken around the world. UNESCO estimates that half of them are in grave danger and might get extinct in a century's time. The native speakers of many indigenous, endangered and under-resourced (low/no finance, contributors, tech knowhow, institutional support, etc.) that are striving to actively use their languages on the internet and other digital spheres face enormous amount of challenges that most dominant languages do not face. This is primarily because the internet is structured with the assumptions of well established and dominant languages in mind. In reality, languages are much beyond just Latin-based languages, right-to-left languages (e.g. Arabic, Hebrew) or the Chinese-Japanese-Korean language group using complex scripts. In fact, a majority of the world languages are only spoken and not written. How does the internet would look like for many under-resourced languages? We're trying to unlearn our language biases, and study the challenges of many small internet community-building the tech foundation for the future AI/ML projects. Some are creating openly-licensed content using platforms like Wikipedia, some are donating pronunciations of words/sentences using projects like Common Voice/Lingua Libre, and some are building an online dictionary that does not exist yet in their own language.

## Approach
We recognize the systemic issues around societal structures which includes oppression of communities as a whole and particularly, women, low-income individuals/families, people with disabilities and other subgroups with less privileges, as a primary cause behind the significantly low growth of AI/ML foundation for many low-resource languages, we are taking many steps back to learn from emerging trends within different low-resource language communities. Our hope is this learning process will help us document in the form of conceptual framing of the issues and the strategies that are essential to address some of the critical issues. We are also conscious of not overburdening many communities -- who are native speakers of our focus languages -- during our interactions which can potentially contribute to the very issues that they have been forced to deal with.

## Updates
* 2021-11-30: Updated the [Linguistic Data](https://github.com/ofdn/Foundational-Language-Tech/tree/main/data) folder with wordlists in three languages -- Ho (indigenous language from India; 1.4 million native speakers; 5,127 words in wordlist when reported), Odia (dominant language from India, ~40 million native speakers; 514,868 words in wordlist) and Santali (indigenous language from India; ~8 million native speakers; 127,359 words in wordlist)
